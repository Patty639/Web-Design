        <h1>Cute Duck</h1>

        <p>Five little ducks went out to play, over the hill and far away
          Mother duck said, “Quack, quack, quack, quack”
          And only four little ducks came back
          (count down until)
          Sad mother duck went out one day, over the hill and far away
          Mother duck said, “Quack, quack, quack, quack”
          And all of her five little ducks came back
